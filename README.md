# PINNs-PyTorch

This is an **unofficial** edition of the PINNs (Physical Informed Neural Networks) algorithm, which employs PyTorch rather than TensorFlow (<2.0). Details of the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs).

Since I am still a newbie to the GitHub community as well as the field of deep learning, my code files probably contain lots of mistakes. Therefore, they are shared only for studying and discussion, and any ideas would be appreciated.
